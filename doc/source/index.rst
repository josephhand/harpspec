Welcome to HARPSpec's documentation!
====================================

.. note::
    
   This project is currently under active development and is subject to change
   drastically.

HARPSpec is a machine learning-based tool for deriving stellar parameters from
spectra as observed by the HARPS high-resolution spectrograph located at the La
Silla observatory in Chile.

HARPSpec relies on a machine learning tool called the cannon, which was designed
to be a faster alternative to manually extracting parameters from spectra, which
is much slower and more time-consuming.
